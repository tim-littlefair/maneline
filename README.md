# maneline

A collection of code and data related to the protocols used to control 
Fender Musical Instrument Corporation's MustangÂ® modelling guitar amplifiers.

# Abbreviations and Definitions

+ FMIC = Fender Musical Instrument Corporation

+ modelling amplifier

  A smart physical (guitar) amplifier product which enables software models of 
  specific or generic prior amplifiers and guitar effect filters/pedals to be 
  selected, so that the modelling amplifier is able to produce a wide range of 
  sounds imitating the effect of the prior amplifiers and effects.
  
  FMIC's amplifiers sold under the 'Mustang' brand are examples of the 
  generic category of modelling amplifiers.

+ preset

  In relation to a modelling amplifier, a setting of the amplifier which 
  causes it to imitate a particular combination of a base amplifier and 
  up to 4 different effects.

  For FMIC Mustang amplifiers, the presets have names and slot numbers starting
  at 1 ranging up to a capacity limit which varies between models and 
  preset versions (for example 1-60 for the Mustang LT40S product running 
  firmware 1.0.7), and can be selected using hardware controls on the amplifier 
  control panel.

# Project Vision

The vision of this project is that it contribute to the community of 
third party developers working to exploration of the capabilities of 
FMIC's Mustang modelling amplifier range and deliver third-party
software solutions to add value to these FMIC products.

Specifically, this project is consists of:
- a command line interface (CLI) application for desktop/laptop/small 
  form factor computers, which will be focussed on exporting 
  and importing the configuration files consumed by the amplifier which 
  define the preset guitar sounds the Mustang product is capable of 
  delivering;
- a mobile application for Android phones and tablets which allows the
  user to create screens grouping a manageable number of favourite 
  presets for efficient switching; and
- a common library, written in Java, which contains common logic 
  used by the two applications listed above, and which is available
  to other developers to use in their own integrations.
- A web application which acts as a wrapper to the CLI application 
  mentioned above, and enables a user interface hosted in a web 
  browser to control the capabilities provided by the CLI application.

# Licensing and Distribution

The original software in this project is licensed under the

The project depends on a wide range of upstream libraries which are used under 
other licenses.  The majority of these are integrated in the form of 
dependencies on Java library packages downloaded from Maven repositories 
as part of the gradle build process, but one library called UsbHid,
orignally published
[here](https://github.com/benlypan/UsbHid).
by GitHub user @benlypan for which I needed to make minor code changes.
My modified version of this library is present in the usb-hid  subdirectory
of this repository, and remains licensed under the the MIT license
selected by @benlypan for his upstream repository.

  -- This bit needs updating
I am planning to release the Android application as a paid download in the Android Play Store.

The app is presently in the Play Store's 'Open Testing' state, when it is finally released 
the Play Store entry for it will be here:
https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.heretical_camelid.maneline.android_app.

**See later in this document for information on how to register as a tester of the app
using a free promo code so you don't have to pay for it.  The current version is a 
proof of concept only and I do not consider anyone should pay any amount for it in 
its current state**

My motivation for seeking payment is not so much to seek revenue, but more to 
discourage feedback on the app except from users who have a reasonably strong motivation 
to use it.  Although I don't expect to make significant revenue from selling the app, it would 
be nice to have a little bit of income as an insurance against the risk (described at length 
[here](https://github.com/tim-littlefair/feral-horse-amp-utils/discussions/13))
that I might brick one of my personal devices when I start to experiment with
uploading modified preset configurations to the amp in the next iteration of development.

I would prefer users who have the necessary skills to spend the time building 
the app from source, but I will be happy to send Play Store free download vouchers to anyone 
who is interested enough in the project to send me a (non-spammy) message requesting this
via my LinkedIn profile, which is referenced on my Github profile page.  

***<span color="red">The desktop CLI application in release 0.1.1 was found to have a fatal
bug described

# Status

As at late of August 2025, initial versions have been developed of 
the library, the desktop CLI application, the Android application 
and the web application.  

The code used to build these versions will be tagged and released on 
GitHub as release 0.2.0 once documentation and testing activities
are completed.

<!--
If you are interested in trying the Android application out, it is presently in 
'Open Testing' state on the Android Play Store.  The page for the app on the 
Play Store is here: 
(https://play.google.com/apps/testing/net.heretical_camelid.maneline.android_app).

Note that the app is a paid app, at this stage of development I would not claim 
it is worth the amount charged, so please use one of the free redemption promo codes
for the app on 
[this page](docs/playstore-promo-codes.rst).

# Prior Art and Credits

This project was inspired by the Linux application 'plug', which is available 
in the 'Universe' section of the Debian, Ubuntu, and related distributions under
the package name 'mustang-plug', and  probably in many others.  This application 
was originally written by a developer called @piorefk, who no longer appears to 
be active anywhere under the Internet (at least under that name), but a 
source code repository based on the original is now maintained 
[on Github](https://github.com/offa/plug)
by user @offa.

The plug application is a C++/Qt GUI which replicates some of the capabilities 
of a group of applications called 'Fender FUSE', originally published by FMIC 
for Windows and MacOS(aka OS/X), but these applications are no longer available 
from or supported by FMIC.  The plug program works with a number of older 
amplifier models released under the Mustang brand name up to about 2016.  

There are a 
[couple](https://github.com/offa/plug/issues/7)
of
[tickets](https://github.com/offa/plug/issues/25)
on 
[@offa's plug repository](https://github.com/offa/plug)
discuss the possibility of adding support to his fork of plug for more recent 
Mustang models, which are interoperable with a recent desktop and moble programs 
from FMIC with names based on the string 'Fender Tone'.  For the main part, 
more recent amps with model names containing the prefix 'LT-' are controlled 
over a USB interface from Fender Tone desktop applications running on Windows 
or macOS, while amps with model name prefixes GT- or  GTX- are controlled over 
a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) connection from mobile applications running on 
iOS and Android.  

There is also a small inline headphone amplifier released in 
2024 called Mustang Micro Plus (MMP) which can also be controlled by FMIC's 
'Fender Tone' mobile applications over Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), and an 
earlier small amp called Mustang Micro (MM) for which FMIC does not supply any 
control application.

I captured and analyzed a sample of BLE messages exchanged between the MMP 
and FMIC's 'Fender Tone' and have determined that the MMP imports and exports
preset definitions using a JSON-based payload format which is similar but 
not identical to the format used by the LT40S.  I am fairly confident that 
it will be possible to add MMP support to the current codebase at some 
time in the (hopefully near) future.     

Before starting work on this project, I created a fork of the plug repository 
in which I have added some partial support for the Mustang LT40S model which I own, 
but this was some way from being fully useful, and without access of any of the 
older amps which plug does provide useful support for I can't be sure that the 
extensive changes I needed to make support the new Fender Tone USB protocol wouldn't 
break the code for the original users of the project for models which used the older 
Fender FUSE protocol.

maneline doesn't use any of the plug code directly, but without the plug codebase
for initial experimentation it would not have got started, so I am very grateful
to @piorefkf and @offa for the platform which got me started on this fascinating 
project.

The architecture of maneline is very messy at the moment, but it is intended that 
it separates concerns of the data payload protocol from the operating system 
platform and the physical datalink layer used to transport commands.  As mentioned
above the UsbHid library by @benlypan is used to provide USB transport on Android,
in the CLI application USB transport is provided by a library called hid4java, by 
[Gary Rowe](https://github.com/gary-rowe), 
available from (https://github.com/gary-rowe/hid4java).  

The present version of maneline supports USB transport only, and has only been tested
with the Mustang LT40S model but I would expect that there is also a likelihood 
that it will work OK with the following other models with LT series model numbers:
- Mustang LT25
- Rumble LT25
- Mustang LT50.

If anyone who owns any of these tries the app out, I'm very interested in hearing 
whether they succeeded or failed, preferably via a comment on 
[the Github discussion page I've set up for Success/Failure reports](https://github.com/tim-littlefair/feral-horse-amp-utils/discussions/14).


# Future plans

The current version of both apps is essentially a proof of concept, and clearly requires
more work to establish a product which is useful to a general owner of any of the 
supported amps (as opposed to a tinkerer like myself).

Features I intend to work on in the near future include:
- releasing a version of the Android app on the Google Play Store so that users
  don't need to build it themselves or sideload a prebuilt copy without the 
  (limited) malware protections offered by Google Play;
- in the longer term, finding some way that users of the Android app can select their
  own suites of favourite presets; and
- adding support to the desktop app for the user to upload a preset definition 
  to the amp.

I own a Mustang Micro Plus amplifier, from Android debug dumps of BLE traffic between 
it and the Android version of Fender Tone it looks like the data payload protocol for 
this is structurally similar to that for the LT40S, so I am hoping to add support for 
BLE transport covering this device  in a future version of maneline.  It is possible that 
support for amplifiers in the GT-/GTX- series could be added if the data payload protocol 
and BLE transport they implement is similar enough to the corresponding protocols
for the MMP.  As the older Mustang Micro (no 'Plus') has a different method of 
selecting presets in its physical UI, I think it is unlikely that support for 
this device is feasible.

There is a branch called 250613-bluez-dbus-experiment which contains some initial
work on evaluating two possible Java/BLE libraries for use in the desktop-app product.
This branch is not yet merged into main - I intend to integrate this branch when the 
work described above on hard-coded genre-based preset suites has stabilized.  Integration
of a BLE capability will be a necessary precondition for interoperation with Mustang 
Micro Plus at least (probably also GT/GTX).
