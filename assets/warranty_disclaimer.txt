NO WARRANTY - DISCLAIMER

The developer of the maneline software is not affiliated in
any way to Fender Musical Instrument Company (FMIC).

The maneline software is experimental and is not intended
for use in a public performance setting.

This software has been tested with a small number of
devices manufactured by FMIC, but the majority of
FMIC device models have not been tested and even for
those models which have been tested the behaviour of
the software may be affected by the firmware version
on the device, and other factors including manufacturing
variations, the state of the user-modifiable presets
stored in the device, ambient temperature, electrical
supply quality etc... .

It is not possible for the maneline developer to guarantee
that operation of the maneline software will not leave
the attached FMIC-manufactured device in bad state,
requiring a power-cycle, factory reset or, in the worst
case, leave the FMIC device permanently 'bricked'.

The user of the software must acknowledge that they
have read this disclaimer, that they choose to
accept the risks which come with running this experimental
software, and that they agree that the developer
of maneline accepts no liability for adverse consequences
caused by running the software.
