# How to contribute

maneline is at present a personal passion project founded and controlled by 
myself [Tim Littlefair](https://linkedin.com/tim-littlefair).

I live in Perth, Western Australia, and I am now semi-retired 
after a 30 year career working in the software development industry, 
and before that an hobbyist and academic interest in software 
development dating back to my schooldays in the mid 1970s.

I'd like to think that it is past the 'initial proof of concept' 
stage, but it isn't a well defined product yet, I'm not confident 
that it ever should be or will be.
